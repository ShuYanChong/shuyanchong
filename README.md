# Readme

A new mobile health (mHealth) / electronic health (eHealth) system, MedFC which utilizes Near Field Communication (NFC) and Text to Speech (TTS) technologies, was developed to manage and enhance the patients’ medication adherence. 

The MedFC system consists of three components, namely the MedFC Web App, MedFC NFC App and MedFC Patient App. The three components are interconnected with an online database, allowing these three Apps to have effective communication with each other. Therefore, MedFC shapes a closed loop feedback environment for patients, caregivers and clinicians to promote medication adherence. The fundamental responsibilities and functions of the three components are listed below.

## MedFC Patient App
• Users: Patients 
• For Patients
- To correctly identify and record the medication consumption information (i.e. dosage, time) via NFC by tapping phone onto NFC tags.
- To correctly identify the medication via TTS as the medication and consumption information would be read aloud upon tapping of NFC tags.
- To remind patients on their medication schedules by enabling reminders.
- To provide effective channel for patients to report any side effect or symptom
experienced to their clinicians.
- To record and report the patients’ medication consumption information to the
online database via internet connection.

#### MedFC NFC App
• Users: Clinicians 
• For Clinicians
- To encode patient’s personal details and their medication information into the NFC tags, which would be given to the patients along with the medication package.

#### MedFC Web App
• Users: Clinicians, Patients and Caregivers 
• For Clinicians
- To prescribe medications to patients. 
• For Patients and Caregivers
- To monitor patient’s medication adherence.
